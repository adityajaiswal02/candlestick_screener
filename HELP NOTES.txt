#for using development mode in flask you have to use 'set' instead of 'export'

#for replacing space use ( ) in the find and replace section, This will replace every space in the file
#for replacing space that is greater than some value for example space after 2 the use ( ){2}

#for ceating a dict with replace find = \n
#and replace it with ',\n'

#for updating the values in the csv files daily, there we have a route name snapshot, we can visit snap shot on local host for the update or we can create
a button for snapshot route in the front end (index.html) both ways it will do the same thing

#maybe the python terminal will give error while running flask debugger, so use cmd terminal instraed, it will run smoothly over there.
